= Secondary indexes

A secondary index (SI) is a data structure that locates all the records in a namespace, or a set within it, based on a bin value in the record.
When a value is updated in the indexed record, the secondary index automatically updates.

You can read more about secondary index implementation and usage in Aerospike https://docs.aerospike.com/server/architecture/secondary-index[on the official documentation page].

== Why Secondary Index

Let's consider a simple query for finding by equality:

[source,java]
----
public List<Person> personRepository.findByLastName(lastName);
----

Notice that findByLastName is not a simple lookup by key, but rather finding all records in a set.
Aerospike has 2 ways of achieving this:

[arabic]
. Scanning all the records in the set and extracting the appropriate records.
. Defining a secondary index on the field `lastName` and using this secondary index to satisfy the query.

The second approach is far more efficient.
Aerospike stores the secondary indexes in a memory structure, allowing exceptionally fast identification of the records that match.

It relies on a secondary index having been created.

== Ways to Create Secondary Indexes

In SpringData Aerospike secondary indexes can either be created by systems administrators using the `asadm` tool, or by developers telling SpringData that such an index is necessary.

There are two ways to accomplish this task with the help of SpringData Aerospike:

[arabic]
. Using AerospikeTemplate `createIndex` method.
. Using `@Indexed` annotation on the necessary field of an entity.

== Creating Secondary Index via AerospikeTemplate

For more information about AerospikeTemplate see the <<aerospike.template, documentation page>>.

Setting a secondary index via AerospikeTemplate can be helpful, for example, in cases when an index creation does not change a lot.

Here is an example of a numeric secondary index for the `rating` field in the `MovieDocument` entity:

[source,java]
----
@Slf4j
@Configuration
public class AerospikeIndexConfiguration {

    private static final String INDEX_NAME = "movie-rating-index";

    @Bean
    @ConditionalOnProperty(
            value = "aerospike." + INDEX_NAME + ".create-on-startup",
            havingValue = "true",
            matchIfMissing = true)
    public boolean createAerospikeIndex(AerospikeTemplate aerospikeTemplate) {
        try {
            aerospikeTemplate.createIndex(MovieDocument.class, INDEX_NAME, "rating", IndexType.NUMERIC);
            log.info("Index {} was successfully created", INDEX_NAME);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            log.info("Index {} creation failed: {}", INDEX_NAME, e.getMessage());
        }
        return true;
    }
}
----

== Creating Secondary Index using @Indexed annotation

You can use `@Indexed` annotation on the field where the index is required.
Here is an example of the `Person` object getting indexed by `lastName`:

[source,java]
----
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor
@Data
@Document
public class Person {
    @Id
    private long id;
    private String firstName;
    @Indexed(name = "lastName_idx", type = IndexType.STRING)
    private String lastName;
    private Date dateOfBirth;
}
----

The annotation allows to specify also bin name, collectionType and ctx (context) if needed.
For the details on using `@Indexed` annotation see <<indexed-annotation, Indexed Annotation>>.

== Matching the Secondary Index

NOTE: In Aerospike, secondary indexes are case-sensitive, they match the exact queries.

Following the query from the example above, assume there was a new requirement to be able to find by `lastName`
containing a String (rather than having an equality match):

[source,java]
----
public List<Person> findByLastNameContaining(String lastName);
----

In this case `findByLastNameContaining` query is not satisfied by the created secondary index.
Aerospike would need to scan the data which can be an expensive operation as all records in the set must be read
by the Aerospike server, and then the condition is applied to see if they match.

Due to the cost of performing this operation, scans from Spring Data Aerospike are disabled by default.

For the details on how to enable scans see <<scan-operation, Scan Operation>>.

Following the query from the example above, assume there was a new requirement to be able to find by `firstName` with an exact match:

[source,java]
----
public List<Person> findByLastName(String lastName);
public List<Person> findByFirstName(String firstName);
----

In this case `firstName` is not marked as `@Indexed`, so SpringData Aerospike is not instructed to create an index on it.
Hence, it will scan the repository (a costly operation that could be avoided by using an index).

NOTE: There are relevant configuration parameters:
xref:#configuration.create-indexes-on-startup[create indexes on startup] and
xref:#configuration.index-cache-refresh-frequency-seconds[indexes cache refresh frequency].
