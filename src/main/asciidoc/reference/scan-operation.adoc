= Scan Operation

A scan can be an expensive operation as all records in the set must be read by the Aerospike server, and then the condition is applied to see if they match.

Due to the cost of performing this operation, scans from Spring Data Aerospike are disabled by default.

== Enabling Scan

If the cost of the scans is acceptable to an organization, they can be enabled by setting xref:#configure-data-settings.scans-enabled[`scansEnabled`] to `true` in `AerospikeDataSettings`.

One way to do this is to create a custom bean which overrides the default settings:

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableAerospikeRepositories(basePackageClasses = { PersonRepository.class})
public class AerospikeConfiguration extends AbstractAerospikeDataConfiguration {
    @Override
    protected Collection<Host> getHosts() {
        return Collections.singleton(new Host("localhost", 3000));
    }

    @Override
    protected String nameSpace() {
        return "test";
    }

    @Bean
    public AerospikeDataSettings aerospikeDataSettings() {
        return AerospikeDataSettings.builder().scansEnabled(true).build();
    }
}
----

NOTE: Once this flag is enabled, scans run whenever needed with no warnings. This may or may not be optimal in a particular use case.
