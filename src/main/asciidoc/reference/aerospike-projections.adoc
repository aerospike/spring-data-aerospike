= Projections with Aerospike

Spring Data Aerospike supports Projections, a mechanism that allows you to fetch only relevant fields from Aerospike for a particular use case. This results in better performance, less network traffic, and a better understanding of what is required for the rest of the flow.

For more details, refer to Spring Data documentation: link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/data-commons/repositories/projections.html[Projections].

For example, consider a Person class:

[source, java]
----
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor
@Data
@Document
public class Person {
    public enum Gender {
        MALE, FEMALE;
    }
    @Id
    private long id;
    private String firstName;
    @Indexed(name = "lastName_idx", type = IndexType.STRING)
    private String lastName;
    @Field("dob")
    private Date dateOfBirth;
    private long heightInCm;
    private boolean enabled;
    private Gender gender;
    private String hairColor;
    private String eyeColor;
    private String passportNo;
    private String passptCnty;
}
----

This is a moderately complex object, and a production object is likely to be more complex. The use case might call for a search box that shows the `firstName`, `lastName` and `dateOfBirth` fields, allowing the user to select a `Person` based on the criteria upon which the full object will be shown.

A simple projection of this object might be:
[source, java]
----
@Data
@Builder
public class SearchPerson {
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    @Field("dob")
    private Date dateOfBirth;
}
----

To tell Spring Data how to create a `SearchPerson` it is necessary to create a method on the `Person` class:

[source, java]
----
public SearchPerson toSearchPerson() {
    return SearchPerson.builder()
            .firstName(this.getFirstName())
            .lastName(this.getLastName())
            .dateOfBirth(this.getDateOfBirth())
            .build();
}
----

Now the repository interface can be extended to return this projection:

[source, java]
----
public interface PersonRepository extends AerospikeRepository<Person, Long> {
    public List<Person> findByLastName(String lastName);
    public List<SearchPerson> findSearchPersonByLastName(String lastName);
}
----

Notice that the method name now dictates the return type of `SearchPerson` as well as changing the return value. When this method is executed, Aerospike loads the full `Person` objects out of storage, invokes the `toSearchPerson` on each person and returns the resulting `SearchPerson` instances. This reduces the required network bandwidth to present these objects to the front end and simplifies logic.
