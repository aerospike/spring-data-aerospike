== Query Modifiers

[width="100%",cols="<12%,<25%,<30%,<25%",options="header",]
|===
|Keyword |Sample |Snippet |Notes

|IgnoreCase |findByLastNameIgnoreCase |...where UPPER(x.lastName) = UPPER(?) |

|OrderBy |findByLastNameOrderByFirstNameDesc |...where x.lastName = ? order by x.firstName desc
|Ordering is done applicatively in Spring Data Aerospike as post-processing of the query results.
If there is a secondary index created for the ordering bin (in this example `firstName`), it is not used,
indexes are relevant only for the main query part before `OrderBy`.
Ordering affects performance depending on the amount of query results

== Limiting Query Results

[width="100%",cols="<12%,<25%,<30%",options="header",]
|===
|Keyword |Sample |Snippet
|First |findFirstByAge | select top 1 where x.age = ?

|First N |findFirst3ByAge | select top 3  where x.age = ?

|Top |findTopByLastNameStartingWith | select top 1 where x.lastName like 'abc%' = ?

|Top N |findTop4ByLastNameStartingWith | select top 4  where x.lastName like 'abc%'

|Distinct | findDistinctByFirstNameContaining | select distinct ... where x.firstName like 'abc%'
|===

NOTE: Query result limiting is performed in Spring Data Aerospike at the application level as a
post-processing step. This limiting can affect performance, depending on the number of query
results and limiting parameters.
