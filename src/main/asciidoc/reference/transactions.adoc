= Transactions

In the context of database operations, a transaction is a sequence of statements that are executed as a single unit of work. Transactions typically follow the A.C.I.D. principle:
[arabic]
. **Atomicity** ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit; either all operations within the
transaction are completed successfully, or none of them are applied.
. **Consistency** ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another, maintaining all
predefined rules and constraints.
. **Isolation** ensures that transactions operate independently of one another, so that intermediate states of a
transaction are not visible to others.
. **Durability** guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, its changes are permanent.

== Choosing Transaction Management Model

Spring offers two models of transaction management: **declarative** and **programmatic**. When choosing between them,
consider the complexity and requirements of your application.

**Declarative transaction management** is typically preferred for its simplicity and ease of maintenance, as it allows
to define transaction boundaries using annotations without altering the business logic code.
This model suits for most applications where transaction boundaries are straightforward and the business logic
does not require intricate transaction control.

**Programmatic transaction management** is chosen when you need more fine-grained control over transactions,
such as handling complex transaction scenarios.
This approach is useful in situations where specific transaction behavior needs to be dynamically adjusted
or when integrating with legacy code that requires explicit transaction management. When using this approach,
it is possible to explicitly start, commit, and rollback transactions within the code if needed.

In general, declarative management is more straightforward and reduces boilerplate code,
while programmatic management offers more control but at the cost of increased complexity.

== Declarative Transaction Management

Declarative transaction management uses annotations to define transaction boundaries and behavior without changing
the business logic code. It’s usually more common in Spring applications due to its simplicity and ease of use.

You can annotate methods and/or classes with `@Transactional` to automatically handle transactions, including
committing or rolling back based on execution.

Couple other things needed to start working with transactions using declarative approach:
[arabic]
. A transaction manager must be specified in your Spring Configuration.
. Spring Configuration must be annotated with the `@EnableTransactionManagement` annotation.

=== Example

Here is an example that shows applying `@Transactional` to a method.
It ensures that the entire method runs within a transaction context, and Spring manages the transaction lifecycle
(automatically committing the transaction if the method succeeds or rolling back if it encounters an exception).

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableTransactionManagement
public class Config {

    @Bean
    public AerospikeTransactionManager aerospikeTransactionManager(IAerospikeClient client) {
        return new AerospikeTransactionManager(client);
    }

    // Other configuration
}

@Service
public class MyService {

    @Transactional
    public void performDatabaseOperations() {
        // Perform database operations
    }
}
----

== Programmatic Transaction Management

Programmatic transaction management gives developers fine-grained control over transactions through code.
This approach involves manually managing transactions using Spring’s API.

The Spring Framework offers two ways for programmatic transaction management:

[arabic]
. Using `TransactionTemplate` or `TransactionalOperator` which use callback approach
(for programmatic transaction management in imperative code it is typically recommended to use `TransactionTemplate`;
for reactive code, `TransactionalOperator` is preferred).
. Directly using a `TransactionManager` implementation.

=== Example

Here is an example that shows using a programmatic transaction in a method.
You would use `TransactionTemplate` to wrap your database operations in a transaction block,
ensuring the transaction is automatically committed if successful or rolled back if an exception occurs.

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class Config {

    @Bean
    public AerospikeTransactionManager aerospikeTransactionManager(IAerospikeClient client) {
        return new AerospikeTransactionManager(client);
    }

    @Bean
    public TransactionTemplate transactionTemplate(AerospikeTransactionManager transactionManager) {
        return new TransactionTemplate(transactionManager);
    }

    // Other configuration
}

@Service
public class MyService {

    @Autowired
    TransactionTemplate transactionTemplate;

    public void performDatabaseOperations() {
        transactionTemplate.executeWithoutResult(status -> {
            // Perform database operations
        });
    }
}
----

== Aerospike Operations Support

Behind the curtains Aerospike transaction manager uses MRTs (multi-record transactions)
which is an Aerospike feature allowing to group together multiple Aerospike operation requests
into a single transaction.

NOTE: Not all of the Aerospike operations can participate in transactions.

Here is a list of Aerospike operations that participate in transactions:

[arabic]
. all single record operations (`insert`, `save`, `update`, `add`, `append`, `persist`, `findById`, `exists`, `delete`)
. all batch operations without query (`insertAll`, `saveAll`, `findByIds`, `deleteAll`)
. queries that include `id` (e.g., repository queries like `findByIdAndName`)

The following operations do not participate in transactions
(will not become part of a transaction if included into it):

[arabic]
. `truncate`
. queries that do not include `id` (e.g., repository queries like `findByName`)
. operations that perform info commands (e.g., `indexExists`)
. operations that perform scans (using ScanPolicy)
